# Intro-To-React
 
This is a brief intro of REACT and details file structure alongside the basics of REACT.


## Introduction to REACT

Built by Facebook/META, REACT is a javascript based framework for developing modern front-end applications. It's a client side framework meaning that you're primarily editing what the user sees. It's similar to other modern frameworks such as Vue or Angular. It's a tool used for building different UI components which can then be pieced together to make a full client front-end.

REACT requires good knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and even CSS to some extent. It primarily relies on JavaScript so if your JavaScript background is weak, it might be a good idea to review up a bit.

REACT works by creating a virtual DOM in memory and before it actually makes change to the browser DOM, it does all the necessary manipulations. This leads to REACT being able to change only what needs to be changed once it finds out which changes are new and have been made.

## Node

Node JS is a JavaScript runtime. It's what we use to manage the backend and is used for building scalable network applications. 

For many REACT applications, Node is critical. Before continuining further, make sure you have Node installed by going to: https://nodejs.org/en/. Note that NPM should be included in your node installation. 

## NPM and NPX

NPM is the world's largest software registry. It holds pacakges which users can use in their applications and they can interact with it using the command line. It is bundled with Node and it will by highly useful for anything related to managing packages.

NPX lets you run a command from a local or remote npm package. For REACT, the main command we'll be doing is `npx create-react-app` which will create a template for us to use.To start, you'll just run the command `npx create-react-app name` where name is the name of the folder. You can also create it in the current folder using `npx create-react-app .`. If you're downloading the react application from online, you can use `npm install` which downloads all the required modules that are needed.

## Github
Since we'll be deploying this REACT application to Github, make sure you have GIT installed on your computer and a github account to use. Setting up github desktop may also be helpful.

## Github Pages
For deploymnent, we'll be making use of Github pages. Github pages will only deploy the front-end side of the REACT application. Github pages is use for static sites and will take all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript then build it into a public website
